"Let Us Burn"

Now darkness has come to the roses
The fire is reaching the end
The colors that I have created
Are suddenly flying away

I'm not fighting myself, will not follow
'Cause my choices are mine it's my fate
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow
I'll face all that is coming my way

Denying the devil of silence
Embracing the world on the edge

[Chorus:]
Let us burn
Let us burn and light up the skies here tonight
Let us burn
Let us burn in this fire that makes us yearn
Whoah. We're fighting our fear of the silence
We're running through walls where they stand
Let us burn
Let us burn
Let us burn

I'm searching no more for tomorrow
I reach for the skies while I can
The unknown will always be waiting
My last day I'll jump in it's hands

I'm not fighting myself, will not follow
'Cause my choices are mine it's my fate
And I'll never bow down from the sorrow
I'll face all that is coming my way

Denying the devil of silence
Embracing the world on the edge

[Chorus]

Why, why don't you let me burn
Why don't you count down and break out and let me burn
Oh why, why don't you let me burn
Why don't you let me burn
Why don't you let me burn
Oh why chasing the demons in my mind
Oh why am I waiting for change
Throwing me to the ground

Now darkness has come to the roses,
The fire is reaching the end...

[Chorus]
